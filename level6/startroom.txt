Finally awake? Yeah, you've been sleeping on the ground.
See that gold tile? Step on it and you win. It's that easy.
What tile you mean? It's just below you!
The red crosses... They're doors! Have you forgotten what a door is?
Find the pressure plates... In red of course! And find something heavy to press it.
A rock probably... In this dungeon there's always going to be heavy rocks...
Are there anything out there? Zombies I guess. And also snakes. Just keep your distance.
Now go! This is MY room for god's sake.
