As you stepped on the final Golden plate,
The Demon King screamed and screeched.
It echoed throughout the chamber and the air vibrated.
At last, it weakened and stopped.
The Demon King is dead. You have defeated Evil itself.
Humanity have been saved. You have rescued it.
Mission accomplished!
The Golden plate teleported you back to the Ruins,
to the surprise of Mr. Zhanng.
"It seems like our Hero has returned. Now pay up!", said the other three old men.
After a feast and celebration, you returned home, and had a long and satisfying sleep.
...
YOU WIN!
