You awake one day to find four old men standing around your bed.
Mr. Zhang, the Movement Coordinator and Kung Fu Master.
Mr. Zheng, the Maze Decoder and Kung Fu Master.
Mr. Zhong, Rock Pusher & Puzzle Extraordinaire and Kung Fu Master.
And, last but not least,
Mr. Zhaang, Slayer of Monsters and Kung Fu Master.
In unison, they say, "Young Hero. Your Time has come."
"You have trained well. And you have grown."
"Now you must face the Evil One. The Wicked One."
"For the people. For our Lives. Remember the Lost Ones."
"Your father...", Mr. Zhanng whispered.
The room is silent. They live in our memories.
"Before you leave for the dungeon - one final recap.", Mr. Zhang commanded.
"Meet us at the Ruins."
The Old men left. You readied your pack, polished your boots, brushed your teeth.
And went out.
