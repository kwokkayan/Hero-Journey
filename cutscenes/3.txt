All that pushing sure is hard work.
Palms are sweaty.
Knees weak.
Arms are heavy.
You wished you could catch a break,
but no rest for the Wicked,
you have to go on.
As you stepped on the golden plate,
an intense golden light was emitted from underneath,
and it soon spread and covered the entire room.
Everything was in gold, nothing was in sight.
Then, the light subsided and retracted, revealing what seems to be...
The second level... The Maze of DESPAIR!
