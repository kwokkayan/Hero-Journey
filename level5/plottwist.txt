Surprisingly, you saw nothing in the Demon King's room.
It turned out that each of the portals in previous levels is one of the Demon King's hearts. 
By winning the 4 levels and going through the 4 portals,  
you destroyed all its 4 hearts. 
Now he has already died and vanished.
Anyway, CONGRATULATIONS! 
You conquered the dungeon and defeated the Demon King!

(THE END)
